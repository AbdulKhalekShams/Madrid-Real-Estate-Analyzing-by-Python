# Madrid-Real-Estate-Analyzing-by-Python

I'm excited to share my latest data analytics project, where I explored and analyzed the Madrid Real Estate Market dataset from Kaggle. This project was a great opportunity to apply both exploratory and inferential statistical methods to real-world housing data.

ðŸ”§ Steps I followed:
âœ… Data Cleaning:

Removed columns with mostly or fully missing values.

Dropped columns with only a single constant value.

Handled missing values by replacing them with the mean or median, depending on the context.

âœ… Feature Selection:

Identified relevant columns based on selected KPIs and created a new refined dataset for analysis.

âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Applied descriptive statistics to understand trends and distributions.

Visualized key variables to uncover patterns in apartment prices and area.

âœ… Inferential Statistics:

Used Linear Regression to build a simple predictive model for apartment prices based on square meters built.

This hands-on project improved my skills in data wrangling, EDA, and basic predictive modeling using Python and Statsmodels.
